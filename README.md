# Phishing Email Classifier

A **Machine Learning–based phishing detection system** that classifies emails as **phishing** or **legitimate** based on their text content. This project applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques and is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an automated phishing email detection system using **TF-IDF** for text vectorization and a **Random Forest Classifier** for prediction. The system helps identify potentially malicious emails based on their content.

Key features:

* Text preprocessing and feature extraction using TF-IDF
* Supervised machine learning with Random Forest
* Saved and reusable trained model
* Interactive Streamlit-based web interface

## 🔍 Model Training & Evaluation

If you want to retrain the model or experiment with the notebook:

1. Ensure the dataset is placed in the `/dataset` directory
2. Activate your Python environment (optional):

   ```bash
   conda activate env_name
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the notebook:

   ```
   Phishing_Email_Classifier.ipynb
   ```
5. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model
6. Save the trained model to:

   ```
   models/random_forest_tfidf_model.pkl
   ```

## 🚀 Run the Streamlit App Locally

From the project root directory, run:

```bash
cd app
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

If successful, a local URL will be generated and opened in your browser.

## ⭐ Future Improvements

* Experiment with advanced NLP models (e.g., BERT)
* Add email metadata features
* Improve model evaluation and reporting
* Deploy using Docker or cloud services
